## About Me

Hello, my name is *Typed*. <br> 

Do you feel overwhelmed with deliverables and looming deadlines? Are you tired of writing your to-dos and schedule on a paper only to misplace that paper? Put your papers and worries away, for I am here to help you! <br>

I will be your personal task manager, storing thousands of tasks with no additional weight. You will be greeted with the more urgent tasks daily, to help you prioritise the day better. You may choose to pull up a calendar view of upcoming events, or sort your tasks by deadline, priority or type. Not sure if you saved the task under *Cara* or *Sara*? I have you covered! Search with either term and I will find what you are looking for. You can even dress me in the theme that pleases you most, should you dislike the way I look. <br>

Unlike other high-maintenance task managers, I am simply simple. Gone are the days of getting frustrated from navigating unfriendly and unintuitive interfaces. With me, there is no need to reach for the mouse anymore. Continue typing on your favourite keyboard, and I will address your commands accordingly. <br>

## 1. Getting Started 

With seemingly never-ending work and errands, it is easy to lose track of what is coming up next. With me, you will not forget another deadline or miss another event. I know it can be difficult to organise and prioritise tons of accumulated tasks. Leave the mess for me to handle, and focus on getting work done instead.  <br>

Before you get started with me, you should have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed. <br>

1. Download the latest `typed.jar` from the **[releases](../../../releases)** tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as my new home.
3. Experiment with **[3. Features](#3-features)** below and try out basic features.

I am always happy to see you again!<br>

1. You will be greeted with a view of default view, with all your undone tasks sorted by deadline. On the left, you will be able to see the overview of each individual type of tasks on hand: overdue, tasks with deadline, events and floating tasks.<br>
